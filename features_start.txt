MRI specific recommendations from paper how to Radiomics 

1. Intensity-Based Features: cause MRI gives intensity based images /!\ MRI often has arbitrary units for intensity --> normalise or discretise intensity values across images to maintain consistency.

2. Texture Features: to capture tissue heterogeneity and subtle variations in signal intensity across different regions. Focus on features derived from:
   - GLCM (e.g., entropy, contrast) for capturing signal variation
   - GLRLM (e.g., run length non-uniformity) for repetitive texture patterns

3. Shape Features: to distinguish structural differences as theyâ€™re independent of the intensity values. Sphericity, compactness, and elongation are relevant, to assess morphology and changes in structure over time.

4. Wavelet-Transformed Features: to enable multi-scale analysis -> capture details at various levels of granularity. Useful for MRI data to highlight both fine and coarse textures, adding robustness across MRI sequences.

Argument : these ensure clinically meaningful segmentation and reduce variability due to the image acquisition process in MRI images data.
